  We decided to use U.S. states' weather data (1975-2024) and the annual corn yields by state. We then sorted these states into different regions:
<ol>
  <li>Humid coastal cold</li>
  <li>Humid inland cold</li>
  <li>Humid coastal hot</li>
  <li>Humid inland hot</li>
  <li>Dry inland hot</li>
  <li>Dry inland cold</li>
  <li>Dry coastal cold</li>
  <li>Dry coastal hot</li>
</ol>

  We loaded and cleaned all of our weather and corn yield data in R. Since we pulled the datasets from many different sources, we condensed the data into state-specific dataframes. We implemented a deep neural network (DNN) to find relationships between our weather data, regions, and crop yields, and make corn yield predictions. </p>
