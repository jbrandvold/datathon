  We decided to use U.S. states' weather data (1975-2024) and the annual corn yields by state. We then sorted these states into different regions:
1. Humid coastal cold
2. Humid inland cold
3. Humid coastal hot
4. Humid inland hot
5. Dry inland hot
6. Dry inland cold
7. Dry coastal cold
8. Dry coastal hot

  We loaded and cleaned all of our weather and corn yield data in R. Since we pulled the datasets from many different sources, we condensed the data into state-specific dataframes. We implemented a deep neural network (DNN) to find relationships between our weather data, regions, and crop yields, and make corn yield predictions. </p>
